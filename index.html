        According to the accounts of the mystical origin of the Oyo Empire, the
        Oyo Mesi are seven principal councillors of the empire. They constituted
        the electoral council and possessed legislative powers, similar to
        todayâ€™s United States Congress. The Bashorun, Agbaakin, Samu, Alapini,
        Laguna, Akiniku and Ashipa are the seven members of this council. They
        represented the voice of the people and had the chief responsibility of
        protecting the interests of the empire. The Alaafin was required to take
        counsel with them whenever any important matter affecting the kingdom
        occurs. When Chief Amuda Olorunkosebi was alive, he was a member of Oyo
        Mesi in Oyo and held the title, Ashipa of Oyo. He was a very
        uncompromising personality and never hid his feelings on any issue as
        one of the advisers to the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi 111.<a
